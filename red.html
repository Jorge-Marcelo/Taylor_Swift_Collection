I’m walking fast through the traffic lights <br>
Busy streets and busy lives <br>
And all we know is touch and go <br>
We are alone with our changing minds <br>
We fall in love 'till it hurts or bleeds <br> <br> 
Or fades in time <br>
    
And I never saw you coming <br>
And I’ll never be the same <br> <br>
    
You come around and the armor falls <br>
Pierce the room like a cannonball <br>
Now all we know is don’t let go <br>
We are alone just you and me <br>
Up in your room and our slates are clean <br>
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes <br> <br> 
    
So you were never a saint <br>
And I've loved in shades of wrong <br>
We learn to live with the pain <br>
Mosaic broken hearts <br>
But this love is brave and wild <br> <br> <
    
And I never saw you coming <br>
And I’ll never be the same <br> <br> 
    
This is a state of grace <br>
This is a worthwhile fight <br>
Love is a ruthless game <br>
Unless you play it good and right <br>
These are the hands of fate <br>
You’re my Achilles heel <br>
This is the golden age of something good <br> 
And right and real <br> <br> 
    
And I never saw you coming <br>
And I’ll never be the same <br> <br> 
    
Oh, I never saw you coming <br>
And I’ll never be the same <br> <br> 
    
This is a state of grace <br>
This is a worthwhile fight <br>
Love is a ruthless game <br>
Unless you play it good and right <br> <br>

Loving him is like driving a new Maserati <br>
Down a dead-end street <br>
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin <br>
Ending so suddenly <br> <br>
    
Loving him is like trying to change your mind <br>
Once you’re already flying through the free fall <br>
Like the colours in autumn, so bright <br>
Just before they lose it all <br> <br>
    
Losing him was blue, like I’d never known <br>
Missing him was dark gray, all alone <br>
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you’ve never met <br>
But loving him was red <br>
Loving him was red <br> <br>
    
Touching him was like realising all you ever wanted <br>
Was right there in front of you <br>
Memorising him was as easy as knowing all the words <br>
To your old favourite song <br> <br>
    
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword <br>
And realising there’s no right answer <br>
Regretting him was like wishing you’d never found out <br>
That love could be that strong <br> <br>
    
Losing him was blue, like I’d never known <br>
Missing him was dark gray, all alone <br>
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you’ve never met <br>
But loving him was red <br>
Oh, red <br>
Burning red <br> <br>
    
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes <br>
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go <br>
But moving on from him is impossible <br>
When I still see it all in my head <br>
In burning red <br> <br>
    
Burning, it was red <br> <br>
    
Oh, losing him was blue, like I’d never known <br>
Missing him was dark gray, all alone <br>
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you’ve never met <br>
‘Cause loving him was red <br>
Yeah, yeah, red <br>
Oh, burning red <br> <br>
    
And that’s why he’s spinning ‘round in my head <br>
Comes back to me burning red <br>
Yeah, yeah <br> <br>
    
His love was like driving a new Maserati <br>
Down a dead-end street <br> <br>

Put your lips close to mine<br>
As long as they don't touch <br>
Out of focus, eye to eye <br>
'Till the gravity’s too much <br>
And I'll do anything you say <br>
If you say it with your hands <br>
And I'd be smart to walk away <br>
But you're quicksand <br> <br>
    
This slope is treacherous <br>
This path is reckless <br>
This slope is treacherous <br>
And I, I, I like it <br> <br>
    
I can't decide if it's a choice <br>
Getting swept away <br>
I hear the sound of my own voice <br>
Asking you to stay <br>
And all we are is skin and bone <br>
Trained to get along <br>
Forever going with the flow <br>
But you're friction <br> <br>
    
This slope is treacherous <br>
This path is reckless <br>
This slope is treacherous <br>
I, I, I like it <br> <br>
    
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night <br>
And I will get you a, get you alone <br>
Your name has echoed through my mind <br>
And I just think you should, think you should know <br>
That nothing safe is worth the drive <br>
And I would follow you, follow you home <br>
I'll follow you, follow you home <br> <br>
    
This hope is treacherous <br>
This daydream is dangerous <br>
This hope is treacherous <br>
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I <br> <br>
    
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night <br>
And I will get you a, get you alone <br>
Your name has echoed through my mind <br>
And I just think you should, think you should know <br>
That nothing safe is worth the drive <br>
And I would follow you, follow you home <br>
I'll follow you, follow you home <br>
I'll follow you, follow you home <br>
I'll follow you, follow you home <br> <br>

Once upon time, a few mistakes ago <br>
I was in your sights, you got me alone <br>
You found me, you found me, you found me <br>
I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that <br>
And when I fell hard, you took a step back <br>
Without me, without me, without me <br> <br>
    
And he's long gone, when he's next to me <br>
And I realize the blame is on me <br> <br>
    
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in <br>
So shame on me now <br>
Flew me to places I'd never been <br>
'Till you put me down <br>
Oh, I knew you were trouble when you walked in <br>
So shame on me now <br>
Flew me to places I'd never been <br>
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground <br> <br>
    
Oh, oh <br>
Trouble, trouble, trouble <br>
Oh, oh <br>
Trouble, trouble, trouble <br> <br>
    
No apologies, he'll never see you cry <br> 
Pretend he doesn't know that he's the reason why <br>
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning <br> 
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street <br>
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be <br>
And now I see, now I see, now I see <br> <br>
    
He was long gone, when he met me <br>
And I realize the joke is on me, hey <br> <br>
    
I knew you were trouble when you walked in <br> 
So shame on me now <br>
Flew me to places I'd never been <br>
'Till you put me down <br>
Oh, I knew you were trouble when you walked in <br>
So shame on me now <br>
Flew me to places I'd never been <br>
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground <br> <br>
    
Oh, oh <br> 
Trouble, trouble, trouble <br>
Oh, oh <br>
Trouble, trouble, trouble <br> <br>
    
And the saddest fear <br> 
Comes creeping in <br>
That you never loved me <br>
Or her, or anyone, or anything <br> 
Yeah! <br> <br>
    
I knew you were trouble when you walked in <br>
So shame on me now <br>
Flew me to places I'd never been <br>
'Till you put me down <br>
Oh, I knew you were trouble when you walked in <br>
So shame on me now <br>
Flew me to places I'd never been <br>
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground <br> <br>
    
Oh, oh <br>
Trouble, trouble, trouble <br>
Oh, oh <br>
Trouble, trouble, trouble <br> 
I knew you were trouble when you walked in <br> 
Trouble, trouble, trouble <br>
I knew you were trouble when you walked in <br>
Trouble, trouble, trouble <br> <br>

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold <br>
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow <br>
And I, left my scarf there, at your sister's house <br>
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now <br> <br>
    
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze <br>
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate <br>
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place <br>
And I can picture it after all these days <br> <br>
    
And I know it's long gone <br>
And that magic's not here no more <br>
And I might be okay <br>
But I'm not fine at all <br> <br>
    
'Cause there we are again on that little town street <br>
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me <br>
Wind in my hair, I was there <br>
I remember it all too well <br> <br>
    
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red <br>
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed <br>
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the Tee-ball team <br>
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me <br> <br>
    
And I know it's long gone <br>
And there was nothing else I could do <br>
And I forget about you long enough <br>
To forget why I needed to <br> <br>
    
'Cause there we are again, in the middle of the night <br>
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light <br>
Down the stairs, I was there <br>
I remember it all too well <br> <br>
    
And maybe we got lost in translation <br>
Maybe I asked for too much <br>
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up <br>
Running scared, I was there <br>
I remember it all too well <br> <br>
    
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise <br>
So casually cruel in the name of being honest <br>
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here <br>
'Cause I remember it all, all, all <br> 
Too well <br> <br>
    
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralysed by it <br>
I'd like to be my old self again <br>
But I'm still trying to find it <br>
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own <br>
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone <br> <br>
    
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week <br>
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me <br>
You can't get rid of it <br>
'Cause you remember it all too well <br> <br>
    
'Cause there we are again, when I loved you so <br> 
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known <br>
It was rare, I was there <br>
I remember it all too well <br> <br>
    
Wind in my hair, you were there <br>
You remember it all <br>
Down the stairs, you were there <br>
You remember it all <br>
It was rare, I was there <br>
I remember it all too well <br> <br>

It feels like a perfect night <br>
To dress up like hipsters <br>
And make fun of our exes, ah, ah, ah, ah <br>
It feels like a perfect night <br>
For breakfast at midnight <br>
To fall in love with strangers, ah, ah, ah, ah <br> <br>
    
Yeah, we're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time <br>
It's miserable and magical <br>
Oh, yeah, tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines <br>
It's time, oh, oh <br> <br>
    
I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22 <br>
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you <br>
You don't know about me but I'll bet you want to <br>
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're 22, 22 <br> <br>
    
It seems like one of those nights <br>
This place is too crowded <br>
Too many cool kids, ah, ah, ah, ah <br>
It seems like one of those nights <br>
We ditch the whole scene <br>
And end up dreaming instead of sleeping <br> <br>
    
Yeah, we're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way <br>
It's miserable and magical <br>
Oh, yeah, tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks <br>
It's time, oh, oh <br> <br>
    
I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22 <br>
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you <br>

22, 22 <br>
    
It feels like one of those nights, we ditch the whole scene <br>

I gotta have you, I gotta have you <br> <br>

I bet this time of night you’re still up <br>
I bet you’re tired from a long hard week <br>
I bet you’re sittin’ in your chair by the window <br>
Looking out at the city <br>
And I bet sometimes you wonder about me <br> <br>
    
And I just want to tell you <br>
It takes everything in me not to call you <br>
And I wish I could run to you <br>
And I hope you know that everytime I don’t <br>
I almost do, I almost do <br> <br>
    
I bet you think I either moved on or hate you <br>
‘Cause each time you reach out, there’s no reply <br>
I bet it never, ever occurred to you <br>
That I can’t say 'hello' to you <br>
And risk another 'goodbye' <br> <br>
    
And I just want to tell you <br>
It takes everything in me not to call you <br>
And I wish I could run to you <br>
And I hope you know that everytime I don’t <br>

We made quite a mess, babe <br>
It’s probably better off this way <br>
And I confess, babe <br>
In my dreams you’re touching my face <br>
And asking me if I'd want to try again with you <br>
And I almost do <br> <br>

I remember when we broke up, the first time<br>
Saying: This is it, I’ve had enough! ‘Cause, like <br>
We hadn’t seen each other in a month <br>
When you said you needed space (what?) <br> <br>
    
Then you come around again and say: Baby <br>
I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me <br>
Remember how that lasted for a day? <br>
I say: I hate you, we break up, you call me, I love you <br> <br>
    
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh <br>
We called it off again last night, but <br>
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh <br>
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you <br> <br>
    
We are never, ever, ever <br>
Getting back together <br>
We are never, ever, ever <br>
Getting back together <br>
You go talk to your friends <br>
Talk to my friends, talk to me <br>
But we are never, ever, ever, ever <br>
Getting back together <br> <br>
    
Like, ever! <br> <br>
    
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights, and me <br>
Falling for it, screaming that I'm right, and you <br>
Would hide away and find your peace of mind with some <br>
Indie record that’s much cooler than mine <br> <br>
    
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh <br>
You called me up again tonight, but <br>
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh <br>
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you <br> <br>
    
We are never, ever, ever <br>
Getting back together <br>
We are never, ever, ever <br>
Getting back together <br>

Talk to my friends, talk to me <br>

Getting back together <br> <br>
    
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah <br>
Ooh, yeah, oh, oh, oh <br> <br>
    
I used to think that we were forever, ever <br>
And I used to say: Never say never <br> <br>
    
Ugh, so he calls me up and he’s like: I still love you <br>
And I'm like, I'm just <br>
Yeah, I mean, this is exhausting, you know? <br>
Like, we are never getting back together <br> 
Like, ever! <br>
No <br> <br>
    
We are never, ever, ever <br>
Getting back together <br>
We are never, ever, ever <br>

You go talk to your friends <br>
Talk to my friends, talk to me <br>

I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night <br>
I threw my phone across the room, at you <br>
I was expecting some dramatic turn away <br>
But you stayed <br> <br>
    
This morning I said we should talk about it <br>
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved <br>
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet <br>
And said: Okay, let's talk! <br>
And I said <br> <br>
    
Stay, stay, stay <br>
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time <br>
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad <br>
But I think that it's best if we both stay <br> <br>
    
Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers <br>
Who took all of their problems out on me <br>
But you carry my groceries, and now I'm always laughing <br>
And I love you because you have given me <br>
No choice but to <br> <br>
    
Stay, stay, stay <br>
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time <br>
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad <br>
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay <br> <br>
    
You took the time to memorize me <br>
My fears, my hopes and dreams <br>
I just like hanging out with you <br>
All the time <br>
All those times that you didn't leave <br>
It's been occurring to me <br>
I'd like to hang out with you <br>
For my whole life <br> <br>
    
Stay <br>
And I'll be loving you for quite some time <br>
No one else is gonna love me <br>
When I get mad, mad, mad <br>
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay <br>
Stay, stay, stay <br> <br>
    
Stay, stay, stay <br>
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time <br>
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad <br>
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay <br>
Stay, stay, stay <br> <br>
    
Stay, stay, stay <br>

I find myself at your door <br>
Just like all those times before <br>
I’m not sure how I got  <br>
All roads, they lead me here <br>
I imagine you are home <br>
In your room, all alone <br>
And you open your eyes into mine <br>
And everything feels better <br> <br>
    
And right before your eyes <br>
I’m breaking <br>
No past, no reasons why <br>
Just you and me <br> <br>
    
This is the last time I’m asking you this <br>
Put my name at the top of your list <br>
This is the last time I’m asking you why <br>
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye <br> <br>
    
You find yourself at my door <br>
Just like all those times before <br>
You wear your best apology <br>
But I was there to watch you leave <br>
And all the times I let you in <br>
Just for you to go again <br>
Disappear when you come back <br>
Everything is better <br> <br>

No past, nowhere to hide <br>

This is the last time I say: It’s been you all along <br>
This is the last time I let you in my door <br>
This is the last time, I won’t hurt you anymore <br> <br>
    
This is the last time I’m asking you this <br>

I was reminiscing just the other day <br>
While having coffee all alone, and, Lord, it took me away <br>
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time <br>
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme <br>
Took off faster than a green light, go <br>
Yeah, you skip the conversation when you already know <br>
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made <br>
And that was the first day <br> <br>
    
And, darling, it was good <br>
Never looking down <br>
And right there where we stood <br>
Was holy ground <br> <br>
    
Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress <br>
We had this big wide city all to ourselves <br>
We block the noise with the sound of 'I need you' <br>
And for the first time I had something to lose <br>
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way <br>
And the story’s got dust on every page <br>
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now <br>
And I see your face in every crowd <br> <br>
    
'Cause, darling, it was good <br>
Never looking down <br>
And right there where we stood <br>
Was holy ground <br> <br>
    
Tonight I'm gonna dance <br>
For all that we've been through <br>
But I don't want to dance <br>
If I'm not dancing with you <br>
Tonight I'm gonna dance <br>
Like you were in this room <br>
But I don't want to dance <br>
If I'm not dancing with you <br> <br>
    
It was good <br>
Never looking down <br>
And right there where we stood <br>
Was holy ground <br> <br>
    
Tonight I'm gonna dance <br>
For all that we've been through <br>
But I don't want to dance <br>
If I'm not dancing with you <br>
Tonight I'm gonna dance <br>
Like you were in this room <br>
But I don't want to dance <br>
If I'm not dancing with you <br> <br>

Long handwritten note deep in your pocket <br>
Words, how little they mean when you’re a little too late <br>
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket <br>
Good girls, hopeful they’ll be and long they will wait <br> <br>
    
We had a beautiful, magic love there <br>
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair <br> <br>
    
In dreams, I meet you in long conversation <br>
And we both wake in lonely beds and different cities <br>
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you <br>
And you’ve got your demons, and darling, they all look like me <br> <br>
    
‘Cause we had a beautiful, magic love there <br>
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair <br> <br>
    
Distance, timing <br>
Breakdown, fighting <br>
Silence, the train runs of its tracks <br>
Kiss me, try to fix it <br>
Could you just try to listen? <br> 
Hang up, give up <br>
And for the life of us we can’t get back <br> <br>
    
A beautiful, magic love there <br>
What a sad, beautiful, tragic... <br>
Beautiful, tragic... <br>
Beautiful... <br> <br>
    
What we had - a beautiful, magic love there <br>
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair <br> <br>

New to town with a made up name <br>
In the angel's city chasing fortune and fame <br>
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream <br>
You had it figured out since you were in school <br>
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool <br>
So overnight you look like a sixties' queen <br> <br>
    
Another name goes up in lights <br>
Like diamonds in the sky <br> <br>
    
And they’ll tell you now, you're the lucky one <br>
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you're the lucky one <br>
But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one? <br> 
Oh, oh, oh <br> <br>
    
Now it's big black cars and Riviera views <br>
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you <br>
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page <br>
And they tell you that you're lucky but you're so confused <br>
'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used <br>
And all the young things line up to take your place <br> <br>
    
Another name goes up in lights <br>
You wonder if you'll make it out alive <br> <br>
    
And they’ll tell you now, you're the lucky one <br>
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you're the lucky one <br>
Can you tell me now, you're the lucky one? <br>
Oh, oh, oh <br> <br>
    
It was a few years later I showed up here <br>
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared <br>
How you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out <br>
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere <br>
Chose the Rose Garden over Madison Square <br>
And it took some time, but I understand it now <br> <br>
    
'Cause now my name is up in lights <br>
But I think you got it right <br> <br>
    
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one <br>
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one <br>
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one <br>
Oh, oh, oh <br> <br>
    
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you're the lucky one <br>
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you're the lucky one <br>
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one <br>
Oh, oh, oh  <br> <br>

All I knew this morning when I woke <br>
Is I know something now, know something now <br>
I didn't before <br>
And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago <br>
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile <br>
In the back of my mind, making me feel like <br> <br>
    
I just want to know you better, know you better <br>
Know you better now <br>
I just want to know you better, know you better <br>
Know you better now <br>
I just want to know you better, know you better <br>
Know you better now <br>
I just want to know you, know you, know you <br> <br>
    
'Cause all I know is we said hello <br>
And your eyes look like coming home <br>
All I know is a simple name <br>
And everything has changed <br>
All I know is you held the door <br>
You'll be mine and I'll be yours <br>
All I know since yesterday <br>
Is everything has changed <br> <br>
    
And all my walls stood tall, painted blue <br>
Well, I'll take 'em down, take 'em down <br>
And open up the door for you <br>
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies <br>
The beautiful kind making up for lost time <br>
Taking flight, making me feel like <br> <br>
    
I just want to know you better, know you better <br>
Know you better now <br>
I just want to know you better, know you better <br>
Know you better now <br>
I just want to know you better, know you better <br>
Know you better now <br>
I just want to know you, know you, know you <br> <br>
    
'Cause all I know is we said hello <br>
And your eyes look like coming home <br>
All I know is a simple name <br>
And everything has changed <br>
All I know is you held the door <br>
And you'll be mine and I'll be yours <br>
All I know since yesterday <br>
Is everything has changed <br> <br>
    
Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time <br>
And meet me there tonight <br>
And let me know that it's not all in my mind <br> <br>
    
I just want to know you better, know you better <br>
Know you better now <br>
I just want to know you, know you, know you <br> <br>
    
All I know is we said hello <br>
Your eyes look like coming home <br>
All I know is a simple name <br>
And everything has changed <br>
All I know is you held the door <br>
You'll be mine and I'll be yours <br>
All I know since yesterday <br>
Is everything has changed <br> <br>
    
All I know is we said hello <br>
So dust off your highest hopes <br> 
All I know is pouring rain <br>
And everything has changed <br>
All I know is a newfound grace <br>
All my days I'll know your face <br>
All I know since yesterday <br>
Is everything has changed <br> <br>

I said: Oh my, what a marvellous tune <br>
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved <br>
The whole place was dressed to the nines <br>
And we were dancing, dancing <br>
Like we're made of starlight <br>
Like we're made of starlight <br> <br>
    
I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45 <br>
Picked me up late one night out the window <br>
We were 17 and crazy, runnin' wild, wild <br>
Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in <br>
The night we snuck into a yacht club party <br>
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince <br> <br>
    
And I said: Oh my, what a marvellous tune <br>
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved <br>
The whole place was dressed to the nines <br>
And we were dancing, dancing <br>
Like we're made of starlight, starlight <br>
Like we're made of starlight, starlight <br> <br>
    
He said: Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change <br>
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues <br>
If you keep thinking that way <br>
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean saying to me <br>
Don't you see the starlight, starlight? <br>
Don't you dream impossible things? <br> <br>
    
Like, oh my, what a marvellous tune <br>
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved <br>
The whole place was dressed to the nines <br>
And we were dancing, dancing <br>
Like we're made of starlight, starlight <br>
Like we're made of starlight, starlight <br> <br>
    
Ooh, ooh, he's talking crazy <br>
Ooh, ooh, dancing with me <br>
Ooh, ooh, we could get married <br>
Have ten kids and teach them how to dream <br> <br>
    
Hoo, hoo, hoo <br>
Hoo, hoo, hoo <br>
Hoo, hoo, hoo <br>
Hoo, hoo, hoo <br> <br>
    
Oh my, what a marvellous tune <br>
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved <br>
The whole place was dressed to the nines <br>
And we were dancing, dancing <br>

Like we're made of starlight, starlight <br>
Like we're made of starlight, starlight <br>
Like we dream impossible dreams <br> <br>
    
Like starlight, starlight <br>
Like we dream impossible dreams <br>

Don't you dream impossible things? <br> <br>

Took a deep breath in the mirror <br>
He didn't like it when I wore high heels <br>
But I do <br>
Turn the lock and put my headphones on <br>
He always said he didn't get this song <br>
But I do, I do <br> <br>
    
I walked in expecting you'd be late <br>
But you got here early and you stand and wave <br>
I walk to you <br>
You pull my chair out and help me in <br>
And you don't know how nice that is <br> 
But I do <br> <br>
    
And you throw your head back laughing <br>
Like a little kid <br>
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny <br>
'Cause he never did <br>
And I've been spending the last eight months <br>
Thinking all love ever does <br>
Is break and burn and end <br>
But on a Wednesday, in a cafe <br>
I watched it begin again <br> <br>
    
You said you never met one girl who <br>
Had as many James Taylor records as you <br>
But I do <br>
We tell stories and you don't know why <br>
I'm coming off a little shy <br>
But I do <br> <br>
    
But you throw your head back laughing <br>
Like a little kid <br>
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny <br>
'Cause he never did <br>
And I've been spending the last eight months <br>
Thinking all love ever does <br>
Is break and burn and end <br>
But on a Wednesday, in a cafe <br>
I watched it begin again <br> <br>
    
And we walked down the block, to my car <br>
And I almost brought him up <br>
But you start to talk about the movies <br>
That your family watches every single Christmas <br>
And I want to talk about that <br>
And for the first time <br>
What's past is past <br> <br>
    
'Cause you throw your head back laughing <br>
Like a little kid <br>
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny <br>
'Cause he never did <br>
And I've been spending the last eight months <br>
Thinking all love ever does <br>
Is break and burn and end <br>

You should've been there <br>
Should've burst through the door <br>
With that: Baby, I'm right here, smile <br>
And it would've felt like <br>
A million little shining stars had just aligned <br>
And I would've been so happy <br> <br>
    
Christmas lights glisten <br>
I've got my eye on the door <br>
Just waiting for you to walk in <br>
But the time is just ticking <br>
People ask me how I've been <br>
As I comb back through my memory <br>
How you said you'd be here <br>
You said you'd be here <br> <br>
    
And it was like slow motion <br>
Standing there in my party dress <br>
In red lipstick <br>
With no one to impress <br>
And they're all laughing <br>
As I'm looking around the room <br>
But there was one thing missing <br>
And that was the moment I knew <br> <br>
    
And the hours pass by <br>
Now I just want to be alone <br>
But your close friends always seem to know <br>
When there's something really wrong <br>
So they follow me down the hall <br>
And there in the bathroom <br>
I try not to fall apart <br>
And the sinking feeling starts <br>
As I say hopelessly: He said he'd be here <br> <br>
    
And it was like slow motion <br>
Standing there in my party dress <br>
In red lipstick <br>
With no one to impress <br>
And they're all laughing <br>
And asking me about you <br>
But there was one thing missing <br>
And that was the moment I knew <br> <br>
    
What do you say <br>
When tears are streaming down your face <br>
In front of everyone you know? <br>
And what do you do <br>
When the one who means the most to you <br>
Is the one who didn't show? <br> <br>
    
You should've been here <br>
And I would've been so happy <br> <br>
    
And it was like slow motion <br>
Standing there in my party dress <br>
In red lipstick <br>
With no one to impress <br>
And they're all standing around me, singing <br>
"Happy Birthday to You" <br>
But there was one thing missing <br>
And that was the moment I knew <br> <br>
    
Ooh, I knew <br> <br>
    
You called me later <br>
And said: I'm sorry, I didn't make it <br>
And I said: I'm sorry too <br>
And that was the moment I knew <br> <br>

You said it in a simple way <br>
4 am, the second day <br>
How strange that I don't know you at all <br>
We stumbled through the long goodbye <br>
One last kiss, then catch your flight <br>
Right when I was just about to fall <br> <br>
    
I told myself: Don't get attached <br>
But in my mind I play it back <br>
Spinning faster than the plane that took you <br> <br>
    
And this is when the feeling sinks in <br>
I don't want to miss you like this <br>
Come back, be here <br>
Come back, be here <br>
I guess you're in New York today <br>
I don't want to need you this way <br>
Come back, be here <br>
Come back, be here <br> <br>
    
The delicate beginning rush <br>
The feeling you can know so much <br>
Without knowing anything at all <br>
And now that I can put this down <br>
If I had known what I know now <br>
I never would've played so nonchalance <br> <br>
    
Taxi cabs and busy streets <br>
That never bring you back to me <br>
I can't help but wish you took me with you <br> <br>
    
And this is when the feeling sinks in <br>
I don't want to miss you like this <br>
Come back, be here <br>
Come back, be here <br>
I guess you're in London today <br>
And I don't want to need you this way <br>
Come back, be here <br>
Come back, be here <br> <br>
    
This is falling in love in the cruelest way <br>
This is falling for you and you are worlds away <br>
    
In New York, be here <br>
But you're in London and I break down <br>
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around <br> <br>
    
This is when the feeling sinks in <br>
I don't want to miss you like this <br>
Come back, be here <br>
Come back, be here <br>
I guess you're in New York today <br>
And I don't want to need you this way <br>
Come back, be here <br>

I’m walking fast through the traffic lights <br>
Busy streets and busy lives <br>
And all we know is touch and go <br>
We are alone with our changing minds <br>
We fall in love 'till it hurts or bleeds <br> <br> 
Or fades in time <br>
        
And I never saw you coming <br>
And I’ll never be the same <br> <br> 
        
You come around and the armor falls <br>
Pierce the room like a cannonball <br>
Now all we know is don’t let go <br>
We are alone just you and me <br>
Up in your room and our slates are clean <br>
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes <br> <br> 
        
So you were never a saint <br>
And I've loved in shades of wrong <br>
We learn to live with the pain <br>
Mosaic broken hearts <br>
But this love is brave and wild <br> <br> <
        
And I never saw you coming <br>
And I’ll never be the same <br> <br> 
        
This is a state of grace <br>
This is a worthwhile fight <br>
Love is a ruthless game <br>
Unless you play it good and right <br>
These are the hands of fate <br>
You’re my Achilles heel <br>
This is the golden age of something good <br> 
And right and real <br> <br> 
        
And I never saw you coming <br>
And I’ll never be the same <br> <br> 
        
Oh, I never saw you coming <br>
And I’ll never be the same <br> <br> 
        
This is a state of grace <br>
This is a worthwhile fight <br>
Love is a ruthless game <br>
Unless you play it good and right <br> <br>

I remember your bare feet, down the hallway <br>
I remember your little laugh <br>
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs <br>
I love you to the moon and back <br>
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine <br>
Like we had our own secret club <br>
I remember you dancing before bed time <br>
Then jumping on me, waking me up <br>
I can still feel you hold my hand, little man <br>
And even the moment I knew <br>
You fought it hard like an army guy <br>
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you <br> <br>
    
"Come on, baby, with me <br>
We're going to fly away from here <br>
You were my best four years" <br> <br>
    
I remember the drive home <br>
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming "Why? " <br>
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say <br>
About a beautiful boy who died <br>
And it's about to be Halloween <br>
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here <br>
I remember the last day, when I kissed your face <br>
And whispered in your ear <br> <br>
    
"Come on, baby, with me <br>
We're going to fly away from here <br>
Out of this curtained room and this hospital gray <br>
we'll just disappear <br>
Come on, baby, with me <br>
We're going to fly away from here <br>
You were my best four years" <br> <br>
    
What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you? <br>
And what if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into? <br>
And what if I really thought some miracle <br>
would see us through? <br>
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you? <br> <br>
    
Come on, baby, with me <br>
We're going to fly away from here <br>
Come on, baby, with me <br>
We're going to fly away from here <br>
You were my best four years <br> <br>
    
I remember your bare feet, down the hallway <br>
I love you to the moon and back <br> <br>

I know I'm probably better off on my own <br>
Than lovin' a man who didn't know <br>
What he had when he had it <br>
And I see the permanent damage you did to me <br>
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic <br> <br>
    
I wish it wasn't 4 AM, standing in the mirror <br>
Saying to myself, "You know you had to do it" <br>
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run <br> <br>
    
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again <br>
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man <br>
And I know why we had to say goodbye <br>
Like the back of my hand <br>
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man <br>
A better man <br> <br>
    
I know I'm probably better off all alone <br>
Than needing a man who could change his mind <br>
At any given minute <br>
And it was always on your terms <br>
I waited on every careless word <br>
Hoping they might turn sweet again <br>
Like it was in the beginning <br> <br>
    
But your jealousy, oh, I can hear it now <br>
Talking down to me like I'd always be around <br>
Push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun <br>
Oh, you never thought I'd run <br> <br>
    
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again <br>
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man <br>
And I know why we had to say goodbye <br>
Like the back of my hand <br>
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man <br>
A better man <br> <br>
    
I hold onto this pride because these days it's all I have <br>
And I gave to you my best <br>
And we both know you can't say that <br>
I wish you were a better man <br>
I wonder what we would've become <br>
If you were a better man <br>
We might still be in love <br>
If you were a better man <br>
You would've been the one <br>
If you were a better man <br>
Yeah, yeah <br> <br>
    
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again <br>
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man <br>
And I know why we had to say goodbye <br>
Like the back of my hand <br>
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man <br>
A better man <br>
(Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again) <br>
We might still be in love, if you were a better man <br>

They tell you while you're young <br>
"Girls, go out and have your fun" <br>
Then they hunt and slay the ones who actually do it <br>
Criticize the way you fly <br>
When you're soaring through the sky <br>
Shoot you down and then they sigh <br>
And say, "She looks like she's been through it" <br>
Lord, what will become of me <br>
Once I've lost my novelty? <br> <br>
    
I've had too much to drink tonight <br>
And I know it's sad but this is what I think about <br>
And I wake up in the middle of the night <br>
It's like I can feel time moving <br>
How can a person know everything at eighteen <br>
But nothing at twenty-two? <br>
And will you still want me when I'm nothing new? <br> <br>
    
How long will it be cute, all this crying in my room? <br>
When you can't blame it on my youth <br>
And roll your eyes with affection <br>
And my cheeks are growing tired <br>
From turning red and faking smiles <br>
Are we only biding time 'til I lose your attention <br>
And someone else lights up the room? <br>
People love an ingénue <br> <br>
    
I've had too much to drink tonight <br>
How did I go from growing up to breaking down? <br>
And I wake up in the middle of the night <br>
It's like I can feel time moving <br>
How can a person know everything at eighteen <br>
But nothing at twenty-two? <br>
And will you still want me when I'm nothing new? <br>  <br>
    
I know someday I'm gonna meet her <br>
It's a fever dream <br>
The kind of radiance you only have at seventeen <br>
She'll know the way <br>
and then she'll say she got the map from me <br>
I'll say I'm happy for her then I'll cry myself to sleep <br>
Oh woah, oh woah, oh, oh <br> <br>
    
I've had (I've had) too much to drink tonight <br>
But I wonder if they'll miss me once they drive me out <br>
I wake up (Wake up) in the middle of the night <br>
And I can feel time moving <br>
How can a person know everything at eighteen <br>
But nothing at twenty-two? <br>
And will you still want me, will you still want me <br>
Will you still want me when I'm nothing new? <br> <br>

What about your promises, promises, promises? (No) <br> <br>
    
What a shame <br>
Didn't wanna be the one that got away, yeah <br>
Big mistake, you broke the sweetest promise <br>
That you never should have made <br> <br>
    
I'm here on the kitchen floor <br>
You call, but I won't hear it <br>
You said, "No one else" <br>
How could you do this, babe? <br>

Her lips on your neck, I can't unsee it <br>

What a shame, didn't want to be the one that got away <br>

I know that you like me <br>
And it's kinda frightenin' standin' here waitin', waitin' <br>

3 Am and I'm still awake, I'll bet you're just fine <br>
Fast asleep in your city that's better than mine <br>
And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree <br>
And I'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me, huh <br> <br>
    
Well, I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles <br>
Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love  <br>
Oh, they sit around talkin' about the meaning of life <br>
And the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of <br> <br>
    
But now that we're done and it's over <br>
I bet you couldn't believe <br>
When you realized I'm harder to forget <br>
than I was to leave <br>
And I bet you think about me <br> <br>
    
You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community <br>
Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills <br>
I was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion <br>
Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills <br> <br>
    
But you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for <br>
And you and I fell like an early spring snow <br> 
But reality crept in, you said we're too different <br>
You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes  <br> <br>
    
Mr. Superior Thinking <br>
Do you have all the space that you need? <br>
I don't have to be your shrink <br>
to know that you'll never be happy <br>
And I bet you think about me <br> <br>
    
I bet you think about me, yes <br>
I bet you think about me <br> <br>
    
Oh, block it all out <br>
The voices so loud, sayin' <br>
"Why did you let her go? " <br>
Does it make you feel sad <br>
That the love that you're lookin' for <br>
Is the love that you had? <br> <br>
    
Now you're out in the world, searchin' for your soul <br>
Scared not to be hip, scared to get old <br>
Chasing make-believe status, last time you felt free <br>
Was when none of that shit mattered 'cause you were with me <br> <br>

But now that we're done and it's over <br>
I bet it's hard to believe <br>
That it turned out I'm harder to forget than I was to leave <br>
And, yeah, I bet you think about me <br> <br>
    
I bet you think about me, yes <br>
I bet you think about me <br> <br>
    
I bet you think about me when you're out <br>
At your cool indie music concerts every week <br>
I bet you think about me in your house <br>
With your organic shoes and your million-dollar couch <br>
I bet you think about me when you say <br>
"Oh my god, she's insane, she wrote a song about me" <br> 
I bet you think about me <br> <br>

He says he doesn't believe <br>
anything much he hears these days <br>
He says, "Why fall in love <br>
just so you can watch it go away? " <br>
He spends most of his nights <br>
wishing it was how it used to be <br>
He spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity <br>
I call, just checking up on him <br>
He's up, 3 A. M. , pacing <br>
He says, "It's not just a phase I'm in" <br>
My voice comes out begging <br> <br>
    
All this time I didn't know <br>
You were breaking down <br>
I'd fall to pieces on the floor <br>
If you weren't around <br>
Too young to know it gets better <br>
I'll be summer sun for you forever <br>
Forever winter if you go <br> <br>
    
He seems fine most of the time <br>
Forcing smiles and never minds <br>
His laugh is a symphony <br>
When the lights go out, it's hard to breathe <br>
I pull at every thread trying to solve the puzzles in his head <br>
Live my life scared to death he'll decide to leave instead <br>
I call, just checking up on him <br>
He's up, 5 A. M. , wasted <br>
Long gone, not even listening <br>
My voice comes out screaming <br> <br>
    
All this time I didn't know <br>
You were breaking down <br>
I'd fall to pieces on the floor <br>
If you weren't around <br>
Too young to know it gets better <br>
I'll be summer sun for you forever <br>
Forever winter if you go <br> <br>
    
If I was standing there in your apartment <br>
I'd take that bomb in your head and disarm it <br>
I'd say I love you even at your darkest and <br>
Please don't go <br> <br>
    
I didn't know <br>
You were breaking down <br>

I'll be your summer sun forever <br>
At 3 A. M. , pacing <br>
All this time I didn't know <br>
At 5 A. M. , wasted <br>
I'd be in pieces on the floor <br>
Forever winter if you go <br> <br>

much he hears these days <br>
I say, "Believe in one thing, I won't go away" <br> <br>

One, two, three, four <br> <br>

Give me the keys, I'll bring the car back around <br>
We shouldn't be in this town <br>
And my so-called friends, they don't know <br>
I'd drive away before I let you go <br>
So give me a reason and don't say no, no <br>
There's a chain 'round your throat <br>
Piece of paper where I wrote <br>
"I'll wait for you" <br>
There's a key on the chain, there's a picture in a frame <br>
Take it with you <br> <br>
    
And run, like you'd run from the law <br>
Darling, let's run <br>
Run from it all <br>
We can go where our eyes can take us <br>
Go where no one else is, run <br>
Ooh, we'll run <br>
Ooh, we'll run <br>
Ooh, we'll run <br> <br>
    
So you laugh like a child <br>
And I'll sing like no one cares <br>
No one to be, no one to tell <br>
I could see this view a hundred times <br>
Pale blue sky reflected in your eyes <br>
So give me a reason and don't say no, no <br>
And the note from the locket, you keep it in your pocket <br>
Since I gave it to you <br>
There's a heart on your sleeve <br>
I'll take it when I leave <br>
And hold it for you <br> <br>
    
And run, like you'd run from the law <br>
Darling, let's run <br>
Run from it all <br>
We can go like they're trying to chase us <br>
Go where no one else is, run <br>
Ooh, we'll run <br>
Ooh, we'll run <br>
Ooh, we'll run <br> <br>
    
There's been this hole in my heart <br>
This thing was a shot in the dark <br>
Say you'll never let 'em tear us apart <br>
And I'll hold onto you while we run <br>
(And we run, and we run, and we run) <br> <br>
    
Like you'd run from the law <br>
(And we run, and we run, and we run) <br>
Darling, let's run (And we run, and we run, and we run) <br>
Run from it all (And we run, and we run, and we run) <br>
We can go where our eyes can take us <br>
(And we run, and we run, and we run) <br>
Go where no one else is, run <br>
(And we run, and we run, and we run) <br>
Ooh, we'll run (And we run, and we run, and we run) <br>
Ooh, we'll run (And we run, and we run, and we run) <br>
Ooh, we'll run (And we run, and we run, and we run) <br> 
Ooh, and we'll run <br> <br>

I wish I could fly <br>
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time <br>
I'd write this in the sky <br>
I miss you like it was the very first night <br> <br>
    
And so it goes <br>
Every weekend the same party <br>
I never go alone <br>
And I don't seem broken hearted <br>
My friends all say they know <br>
Everything I'm going through  <br>
I drive down different roads <br>
But they all lead back to you <br>
'Cause they don't know about the night in the hotel <br>
They weren't riding in the car when we both fell <br>
Didn't read the note on the Polaroid picture <br>
They don't know how much I miss you <br> <br>
    
I wish I could fly <br>
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time <br>
I write this in the sky <br>
I miss you like it was the very first night <br> <br>
    
And so it was <br>
We never saw it coming <br>
Not trying to fall in love <br>
But we did like children running <br>
Back then we didn't know <br>
We were built to fall apart <br>
We broke the status quo <br>
Then we broke each other's hearts <br>
But don't forget about the night out in L. A <br>
Dance in the kitchen, chase me down through the hallway <br>
No one knows about the words that we whisper <br>
No one knows how much I miss you <br> <br>
    
I wish I could fly <br>
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time <br>
I'd write this in the sky <br>
I miss you like it was the very first night <br> <br>
    
Take me away <br>
Take me away <br>
Take me away <br>
To you, to you <br>
Take me away <br>
Take me away <br>
Take me away <br>
To you, to you <br> <br>
    
I remember the night at the hotel <br>
I was riding in the car when we both fell <br>
I'm the one on the phone as you whisper <br>
"Do you know how much I miss you? " <br> <br>
    
I wish that we could go back in time <br>
And I'd say to you <br>
"I miss you like it was the very first night" <br> <br>
    
I wish I could fly <br>
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time <br>
I'd write this in the sky <br>
I miss you like it was the very first night <br> <br>
    
Take me away <br>
Take me away <br>
Take me away <br>
To you, to you <br>
Take me away <br>
Take me away <br>
Take me away <br>
To you, to you <br> <br>

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold <br>
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow <br>
And I, left my scarf there, at your sister's house <br>
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now <br> <br>
        
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze <br>
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate <br>
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place <br>
And I can picture it after all these days <br> <br>
        
And I know it's long gone <br>
And that magic's not here no more <br>
And I might be okay <br>
But I'm not fine at all <br> <br>
        
'Cause there we are again on that little town street <br>
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me <br>
Wind in my hair, I was there <br>
I remember it all too well <br> <br>
        
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red <br>
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed <br>
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the Tee-ball team <br>
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me <br> <br>
        
And I know it's long gone <br>
And there was nothing else I could do <br>
And I forget about you long enough <br>
To forget why I needed to <br> <br>
        
'Cause there we are again, in the middle of the night <br>
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light <br>
Down the stairs, I was there <br>
I remember it all too well <br> <br>
        
And maybe we got lost in translation <br>
Maybe I asked for too much <br>
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up <br>
Running scared, I was there <br>
I remember it all too well <br> <br>
        
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise <br>
So casually cruel in the name of being honest <br>
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here <br>
'Cause I remember it all, all, all <br> 
Too well <br> <br>
        
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralysed by it <br>
I'd like to be my old self again <br>
But I'm still trying to find it <br>
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own <br>
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone <br> <br>
        
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week <br>
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me <br>
You can't get rid of it <br>
'Cause you remember it all too well <br> <br>
        
'Cause there we are again, when I loved you so <br> 
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known <br>
It was rare, I was there <br>
I remember it all too well <br> <br>
        
Wind in my hair, you were there <br>
You remember it all <br>
Down the stairs, you were there <br>
You remember it all <br>
It was rare, I was there <br>
I remember it all too well <br> <br>
